# AI-Powered Skin Disease Diagnosis

## Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to diagnose various white spot skin conditions. The model achieves 93% accuracy in diagnosing skin conditions, making it a reliable tool for preliminary diagnosis.

## Features

- **Advanced CNN Model**: Developed a CNN model that achieves 93% accuracy in diagnosing white spot skin conditions.
- **Cross-Platform Solution**: Created a cross-platform solution with both mobile and web interfaces.
- **Comprehensive Diagnostic Questionnaire**: Implemented a comprehensive diagnostic questionnaire system to gather detailed patient information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3**: The project uses Python for model development and deployment.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Flask/Django**: For the web interface.
- **React Native**: For the mobile interface.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing patient data and diagnostic results.
